            <h2>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>
                Super Smash Bros. Ultimate received universal acclaim from both
                critics and players, with some critics calling it the best
                installment in the series. It received praise for its large
                amount of content and fine-tuning of existing Smash gameplay
                elements, although its online mode was widely
                criticized.</strong
