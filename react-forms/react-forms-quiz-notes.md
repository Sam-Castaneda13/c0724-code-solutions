## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- How do controlled components differ from uncontrolled components? Controlled stores each value in React State and then set the value of each input on each re-render from that state. While Uncontrolled inputs do not save the input values in React state. Instead, uncontrolled forms use the native, built-in <form> functionalities of vanilla HTML and JavaScript to manage data.

- What are some advantages of using uncontrolled components? It helps with having less boilerplate then compared to the controlled version. It also contains no state

- What are some advantages of using controlled components? If another function updates the state, that will immediately be reflected in the components’ values. If your React logic does not render the form inputs, the values will still be maintained in your app’s state.

- Which style do you prefer?

- What two props must you pass to an input for it to be "controlled"?

- What are some popular npm packages for creating forms in React? React Hook Form, Formik, React Final Form
