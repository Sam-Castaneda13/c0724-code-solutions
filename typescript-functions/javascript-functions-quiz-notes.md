## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript? It is a thing to be able to make reusable blocks of code

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**. functionName then (parameters) then {inside has the code and return} then close curly brace

- Describe the parts of a function **call**. functionName();

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**? the definition has the full code in it while to the call just runs the definition and takes the answer

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**? Parameters are the parts inside the function while the arguments are the variables being sent to the function.

- Why are function **parameters** useful? It allows you to use variables that are being sent from the main part of the code.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function? Cause the function to produce a value we can use in our program, and prevents any more code in the function's code block from being run.

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function? const add = (num1, num2) => {}

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality? It changes requiring no return operator or no need for curly braces and it can only be one line.
