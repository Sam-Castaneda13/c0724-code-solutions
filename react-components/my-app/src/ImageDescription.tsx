      Shinx is a quadrupedal, feline Pokémon resembling a lion cub or lynx
      kitten. Its front half is light blue, while the rear is black. There is a
      short tuft of fur on its head and smaller tufts on each cheek. The top
      tuft is smaller on the female Shinx. It has large, oval ears with yellow,
      star-shaped markings on the insides; yellow eyes; and a tiny, red nose.
      Whenever its mouth is open, small fangs can be seen in its upper jaw. A
      black marking encircles Shinx's neck like a collar, and there are yellow
      bands above its forepaws. The hind paws are black on the male Shinx and
      blue on the female. Spiked fur surrounds the base of its long tail, which
      is tipped with a yellow star shape. Electricity is produced by the
      extension and contraction of muscles in Shinx's forelegs, which causes
      this Pokémon's fur to glow. If it senses danger, its fur can gleam
      brightly to blind predators so it can flee. Excited trembling is a sign
      that Shinx is generating tremendous amounts of electricity. It can send
      signals to other Shinx by shining the tip of its tail and shaking it. It
      has an aggressive nature; thus, taming a Shinx is said to take great
      patience.
