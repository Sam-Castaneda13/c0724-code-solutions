## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are modules? Are a collection of code in an external file which performs a specific task or function

- What is the difference between named and default imports? As you can see, once the Header component is imported into the App.tsx file, it can be called just like any other component. Not having to define all of the components needed for an application in one file makes your life as a developer much easier, and allows you to more readily organize your code for clarity and maintainability.

- What is the difference between named and default exports?a default export allows the content of what is being exported to be named in the file which is importing it. Named exports and imports maintain the name of the entity being exported from one module and imported into another.
